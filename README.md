# Timeless Brews - A Time-Bending Coffee Shop Adventure

Welcome to Timeless Brews, a unique game jam project where you step into the role of a barista with the power to manipulate time! Serve customers from different eras, craft delicious drinks, and navigate the complexities of time travel.
In "Timeless Brews," you are a barista with the extraordinary ability to manipulate time. Your café serves customers from various eras, from an ancient Greek philosopher to a 1920s jazz musician, even a robot from the future. Each patron has a unique story and a problem to solve. Utilize your time-bending powers to slow down, rewind, or even stop time to truly understand their needs and serve them the perfect beverage. As you navigate through their tales, you'll also unravel a mysterious time paradox that threatens the fabric of reality.
